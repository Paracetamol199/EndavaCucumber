# Cucumber integration with rest assurred

## Two profiles in maven

### Rest assurred profile


### Cucumber profile

Feature file for cucumber tests

Notes:
Lose the configuration stuff and testConfiguration class

Have two packages, one with actual rest assurred steps and one with cucumber + rest assurred
